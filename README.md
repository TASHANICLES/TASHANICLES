### Hi there!

This is my first repository using this account.

It is different from other repositories in the sense that it does not contain only one project.  Since I am working by myself at the moment, it almost seemed silly 
to create a separate repo for each project, each of which can have one branch and that's it.  Therefore, as an experiment of sorts I am creating this master repo 
to hold branches for each project.

In such a case I am not sure what the master branch would look like, so I may just keep all of the branches separate, except if any of the projects actually get 
big enough to necessitate additional branches, in which case that project would get its own main branch that they would all merge into.

The only things that would be merged onto the main master branch would be general files that pertain to all of them (such as the .gitignore or the ReadMe, for 
example).

I shall see how this works.  Hopefully it will work out well.
